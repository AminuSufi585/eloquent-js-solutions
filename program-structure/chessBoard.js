/**
    ChessBoard
    Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
    characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
    or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
    Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
    # # # #
    # # # #
    # # # #
    # # # #
    # # # #
    # # # #
    # # # #
    # # # #
    When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
    = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size , outputting a grid
    of the given width and height.
